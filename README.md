# 'Time' and 'Symbols' -The main idea that could be explained in a short and simple video is :


This is the story of 'Time' and 'Symbols', they loved each other but didn't know how to sync between them, how to get along, the reality was becoming more complicated and they were not able to understand each other, 'Symbols' was too unpredictable in some situations and 'Time' was all about indexing events and in certain moments couldn't follow 'Symbols' train-of-thoughts. They felt they needed to evolve and were ready to work on it. They realized they were under many levels of 'Ignorance'. 

So they decided to ask for help from their friends from the numbers world,$\pi$ , $e$, and $i$ (who was born an orphan), after a while more folks joined the team, many odd some mysterious primes.  

They started working together, playing and brainstorming about how to help 'Time' and 'Symbols'  improve their relationship. 

They realized that special beings they observed amazed sometimes while playing, called 'complex iterators', were $i$'s parents and that they were expecting to be seen.  

They had answers to give and wanted their son to know that his real name is $j$ (I know this pun hurts many people).


$$ T_o  = \frac{1}{2}(1+\sqrt{5})$$

And we have as root of unity for the discrete time index for the selected $T_o$:

$$ \tau = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{T_o}}$$



$$\delta[0]=\delta_0 =\frac{1}{T_o}$$

$$\delta[n] =\begin{cases} \delta_0\space for \space n=0\space mod\space T_o \\
                     0\space for \space n > 0 \space mod\space T_o \\
       \end{cases}$$

$$r[-1]=0$$


$$r[n] = r[n-1] + \delta[n] $$


Time evolves, and becomes interested in modularity:

$$\hat n[n] =r[n]Â·\tau^{n}$$
